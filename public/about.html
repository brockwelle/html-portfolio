<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I’m Eric, a Geographer living in Peoria, IL. I enjoy traveling, rowing, and drawing. I’m also interested in innovation. Most of all, I love spending time with my three cats and new granddaughter.</p>

<p>I've worked as both an individual contributor and a people leader in the following industries:
  <ul>
    <li>Environmental Protection</li>
    <li>Oil & Gas</li>
    <li>Transportation</li>
    <li>International Development</li>
    <li>Transportation Planning</li>
    <li>Automotive Manufacturing</li>
  </ul>
  In the following countries:
  <ul>
    <li>United States</li>
    <li>Kazakhstan</li>
    <li>Iraq</li>
    <li>Jordan</li>
    <li>Qatar</li>
    <li>Thailand</li>
  </ul>
  Under various mixes of the following regimes:
  <ul>
    <li>Part Time</li>
    <li>Full Time</li>
    <li>Overtime</li>
    <li>Rotational</li>
    <li>Temporary</li>
    <li>Direct Hire</li>
    <li>Contractor</li>
    <li>Consultant</li>
    <li>via Manpower Agency</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>I’ve worked on teams solving real world problems, including: how to get oil out of the North Caspian Sea
  and the Gulf of Thailand with the least negative impact to environment/community/safety; how to clean
  up the Gulf of Mexico during/after an oil spill; how to increase the amount of water available to rebuild
  the agriculture sector in Iraq; and how to build better maps using ML to navigate autonomous vehicles.
  </p>

<p>What would you do if you couldn't fail?</p>
